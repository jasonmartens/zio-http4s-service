### Example project using ZIO, Http4s, and Doobie

This is a sample web service project largely copied from https://github.com/mschuwalow/zio-todo-backend/ and https://github.com/edvmorango/edm-user-service-api. The goal was to start from something as simple as possible, and add additional features to understand how all the pieces fit together.
